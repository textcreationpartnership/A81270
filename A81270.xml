            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4th.

               <hi>William Ramſden, William Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Anthony Lambert, Humphry Duncalfe,</hi> and
<hi>Henry Maſters,</hi> Aldermen of <hi>Hull,</hi> was preſented to his Majeſty and Council on behalf (as is alledged) of themſelves and the chief Burgeſſes of that Town, wherein they ſet forth, That Alderman <hi>Hoare</hi> had not made appear to them that he took the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within twelve Months before his Election, and therefore they had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his place void, and were adviſed it would be of dangerous conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Petitioners and other the Juſtices and Officers of that Town, to join in any Act of adminiſtration of Juſtice with one whoſe place was void: Prayed therefore the Diſcharge of the Order of Council for <hi>Hoare</hi>'s continuing Alderman, that the matter might be heard in Council, and Mr. <hi>Hoare</hi> left to his remedy at Law for being reſtored to the ſaid Office.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty upon reading the ſaid Petition was pleaſed to order a Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Matter at Council-Board within ten days after notice to Mr. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman <hi>Hoare;</hi> which Hearing falls out to be the 15. <hi>Sept.</hi> 1680.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hoare</hi> obtained an Order for ſummoning Witneſſes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 31. 1680.</note> which being to be ſent to <hi>Hull,</hi> and they ſummon'd and to come up by the 15th. of <hi>Sept.</hi> was almoſt impoſſible, eſpecially it falling out that moſt of them were then to be at <hi>Holden</hi>-Fair. Wherefore he by two humble Petitions two ſeveral Council-days, pray'd a further time; but the more important Affairs of State prevented the making any Order upon thoſe Petitions, ſo that he will want much of the Evidence upon his Hearing, which otherwiſe he might have had.</p>

<hi>Hull,</hi> and about 120 of the Chief Burgeſſes of that Town. The Contents whereof is as followeth.</p>

            <p>UPon the whole matter the ſaid <hi>Hoare</hi> moſt humbly offers to Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, That there is no Objection made againſt him in the Petition, or otherwiſe, ſave only that he had not made it appear that he took the Sacrament according to the Rites of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> within one year before his Election; but the Petition doth not ſay that
<hi>Hoare</hi> had not taken it within that time.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to which Objection he prays that it may be obſerved:</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Act of 13th of the King for Regulating Corporations, does not require any man after he hath been in an Office 9 or 10 years, to prove he took the Sacrament within twelve Months before his being Elected into the ſame; if it did, and if all men in Office were to be turn'd out that could not make ſuch proof, it's more than probable that half the Officers in <hi>England</hi> would be removed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is poſitively proved he took the Sacrament and Oaths, abjured the Covenant, ſigned the Declaration by Law required, before he was Sworn Alderman, and did the like in 1674, when he was choſen and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mayor, and hath duly taken the Sacrament every year ſince, and is now a Juſtice of Peace, and therefore after having ſerved Mayor, and ſpent near 800
<hi>l.</hi> in Fines, and defraying the charge of that Office, it would ſeem very hard to put him out of his Office of Alderman, only becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove he took the Sacrament within twelve Months before he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to that Office, eſpecially ſince that choice did not make him Alderman till he was Sworn, and before he was Sworn he had done all that the Law required, to capacitate him for Alderman.</p>
            <p n="3">III. He being choſen 8. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1671, and Sworn the 22th. of that Month, if he had not taken the Sacrament before his Election, and by reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his Office of Alderman had been void according to the ſtrict letter of the Law; yet by his Majeſties Gracious Act of free Pardon paſt in 1672 that omiſſion is forgiven, and it is not in the leaſt pretended that he hath done any Act ſince whereby to forfeit his ſaid Office, which he hath many times freely offered to have laid down, and doth not now conteſt the ſame for any benefit or profit that ariſes thereby, but meerly to defend his Loyalty and Integrity, and prevent the affront deſigned to be given him, by ſome few of the preſent Aldermen.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Intent of the Act of 13th of the King was to prevent diſloyal perſons, or perſons diſſenting from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen into Offices; but was never deſigned to turn Loyal Subjects and true Sons of the Church out of Offices, becauſe they had not the ſpirit of Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to know before-hand when they ſhould be choſen into Offices, and ſo take the Sacrament purpoſely to qualifie them for ſuch Elections.</p>
